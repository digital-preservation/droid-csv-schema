| This schema is designed to run on a CSV exported from The National Archives' |
| DROID file format identification tool profile.  It will report an error for  |
| any files where the checksum does not match the one originally calculated    |
| or if any files or folders have been added or removed since the original     |
| The error report will give the data line number of the error, and also the   |
| data line number where the CSV Validator first encountered that checksum.    |
| These line numbers do not include the header row, so if viewing your CSV file|
| in Excel or OpenOffice Calc you will need to add one to the reported line    |
| number to find the relevant entry.                                           |
|                                                                              |
| As folders do not have a checksum, we exclude them from the checksum check   |
| by examining the URI field, if the URI ends with a slash, we check just that |
| the SHA256_HASH is empty. If the RESOURCE column from DROID were included in |
| the output could use if($RESOURCE/is("folder") to test instead.              |
| to run this you will need to replace "files" in the integrityCheck test      |
| with the name of the top level Folder in your DROID report. That is, if you  |
| ran the report starting at, for example, C:\users\documents, replace         |
| files with documents.                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| We also need to skip files inside zips and other containers for this purpose |
| as it is sufficient to check that the container itself is unchanged.         |
|                                                                              |
