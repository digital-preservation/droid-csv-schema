|This version is for WO 95 digitisation in the period 2014-15.  Field definitions should be essentially the same|
|as in the schema tech_acq_metadata_v1_WO95Y14B000.csvs but as file_path and resource_uri are not known at the  |
|stage the scanning list is created, and so are not included in this schema, cross references are removed       |
