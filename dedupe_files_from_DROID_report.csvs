| This schema is designed to run on a CSV exported from The National Archives' |
| DROID file format identification tool profile.  It will report an error for  |
| any duplicate files within the report, allowing you to deduplicate material  |
| held within the area of interest.                                            |
|                                                                              |
| When exporting the CSV from DROID, choose the option to have one row per     |
| format.                                                                      |
|                                                                              |
| The error report will give the data line number of the error, and also the   |
| data line number where the CSV Validator first encountered that checksum.    |
| These line numbers do not include the header row, so if viewing your CSV file|
| in Excel or OpenOffice Calc you will need to add one to the reported line    |
| number to find the relevant entry.                                           |
|                                                                              |
| As folders do not have a checksum, we exclude them from the uniqueness check |
| by examining the URI field, if the URI ends with a slash, we check just that |
| the SHA256_HASH is empty. If the RESOURCE column from DROID were included in |
| the output could use if($RESOURCE/is("folder") to test instead.              |
|                                                                              |
| To handle the case of files identifying with multiple possible formats, we   |
| check the checksum for uniqueness only for the first identification.         |
|                                                                              |
