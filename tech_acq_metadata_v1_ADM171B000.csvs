batch_code: length(1,10) regex("^ADM171(B|S)([0-9]{3}|smp)$")
  //1st part, batch_code must be between 1 and 11 characters long, and (implicitly multiple conditions are joined  
  //by a logical AND unless another boolean is provided). 2nd part restricts to form similar to ADM171B000 (last
  //three digits are running number for batches throughout the project.
department: is("ADM") and (in($file_path) and in($resource_uri))
  //Parentheses control evaluation order of booleans as might be expected
  //Department is fixed value of WO for this project. 
  //The grouped "in" statements say that the value found in this field must also be found as part of the fields 
  //"file_path" and "resource_uri"
division: is("25")
  //this field must be precisely 21
series: is("171") and (in($file_path) and in($resource_uri))
  //Fixed value of 171 for this project
  //The value must also be part of the fields "file_path" and "resource_uri"
piece: range(183,187) or is("203") and (in($file_path)and in($resource_uri))
 //The value must also be part of the fields "file_path" and "resource_uri"
item: (switch(($piece/starts("183"),range(1,339)),($piece/starts("184"),range(1,340)),($piece/is("185"),range(1,338)),($piece/is("186"),range(1,518)),($piece/is("187"),range(1,9999)),($piece/is("203"),range(1,9999))) and in($file_path)) or is("")
  //Most pieces are subdivided into items, ranges given are based 
  //The value must also be part of the fields "file_path" and "resource_uri"
  //In many cases the item level is not used, so this would be left blank.
  //as the sorting/cataloguing process advances this condition may be tightened
ordinal: range(1,22) and in($file_path) unique($department,$division,$series,$piece,$item,$ordinal)
  //the ordinal is a simple running count of the images within an item (or piece if not itemised).
  //No single item (or piece if not itemised) should contain more than 150 pages but rule changed to 500 to allow for exceptions
  //This (with leading zeroes) also forms the final part of the filepath, immediately before the .jp2 extension
  //the combination of fields indicated should be unique within the file
file_uuid: uuid4 unique
  //must be a version 4 uuid, and the value must be unique within the file.  uuids must be lower case.

  //fileExists checks that there is actually a file of the given name at the specified location on the file system.
  //In practice, the validator will normally be run with the --path switch 
  //(see http://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-validator/)
  //We also require that the path is a valid uri, and matches overall regex("^file:\/\/\/ADM_171\/content\/[0-9]{1,5}\/[1-9][0-9]{0,4}\/[0-9]{1,5}_[1-9][0-9]{0,4}_[1-9][0-9]{0,4}_(000[1-9]|00[1-9][0-9])\.jp2$") as this is the top-level folder for each batch
  //With schema V1.1 we can more precisely specify the exact form of the URI by using concat and the specific values for piece and item
  //(Conditions specified on earlier columns say that the values of those columns must also appear as part of the 
  //content of this field)
  //must be unique within the file
file_checksum: unique checksum(file($file_path),"SHA-256")
  //Compare the value given in this field to the checksum calculated for the file found at the location given in 
  //the "file_path" field (again path substitution may well be applied as described for the "file_path" field itself).
  //Use the specified checksum algorithm (must use lowercase hex characters).
  //unique within the file - an identical checksum would imply identical images
resource_uri: uri is(concat("http://datagov.nationalarchives.gov.uk/66/",$department,"/",$series,"/",$piece,"/",$file_uuid)) unique
  //Must be a valid uri which starts with the specified string, ad then comprises the fields indicated, separated by /, the uri is constructed such that it must be unique in the file
  //(Conditions specified on earlier columns say that the values of those columns must also appear as part of the 
  //content of this field)
scan_operator: length(1,12) regex("^[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,12}$") is("TNAgeneric")
  //12 alphanumeric characters representing the identity of the scanning operator (the ability to decode this is
  //restricted to the scanning company to avoid personally identifying data being held in the file
scan_id: length(1,12) regex("^[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,12}$") is("TNAgeneric")
  //Like "scan_operator", but this code represents the actual scanner or camera used
scan_location: regex("[-\w\s,.]+") is("The National Archives, Kew")
  //Address or other description of the location where scanning physically occurred. The regex allows any number
  //of characters, allows general word and whitespace characters plus hyphen, comma and full stop
image_resolution: positiveInteger is("300")
  //Always a positive (non-zero) integer, and in general explicitly 300. Occasionally a higher resolution used.
  //Depending how this is populated (whether nominal or actual resolution), it might be better to use a range
  //eg range(298,302) to capture slight variances in resolution.
image_width: //positiveInteger
  //Must be a positive (non-zero) integer. The material in this series is very varied in size, so no checking is attempted beyond this
image_height: //positiveInteger
  //Must be a positive (non-zero) integer. The material in this series is very varied in size, so no checking is attempted beyond this
image_tonal_resolution: is("24-bit colour")
  //must be string: 24-bit colour (precisely - case as shown).  Occasionally a different value might be specified.
image_format: is("x-fmt/392")
  //must be string: x-fmt/392 (precisely) - ie a jp2 file as understood by PRONOM
  //(http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/x-fmt/392)
image_compression: positiveInteger is("6")
  //Always a positive (non-zero) integer, generally 6 to represent 6-fold compression with the lossy algorithm 
  //available in the JPEG2000 specification
image_colour_space: is("sRGB")
  //must be string: sRGB (precisely - case as shown)
image_split: is("yes") or is("no")
  //must be string: yes; or string: no (precisely - case as shown).  Used if eg an image of complete double page
  //subsequently split into two separate images of each page individually
image_split_other_uuid: if($image_split/is("no"),is(""),regex("^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-4[a-f0-9]{3}-[89ab][a-f0-9]{3}-?[a-f0-9]{12}(,[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-4[a-f0-9]{3}-[89ab][a-f0-9]{3}-?[a-f0-9]{12}){0,8}$"))
  //if "image_split" field is no, must be blank
  //else it must be a uuid4 or comma separated list of up to 9 uuid4s
  //due to the requirement to allow a comma separated list regex has had to be used, rather than the built in uuid4 datatype
image_crop: is("auto") or is("manual") or is("none")
  //must be string: auto; or string: manual or string: none (precisely - case as shown)
image_deskew: is("yes") or is("no")
  //must be string: yes; or string: no (precisely - case as shown)
