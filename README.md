CSV Schemas
===========

CSV Schemas expressed in the [CSV Schema Language](http://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-schema/csv-schema-1.0.html).

CSV Schema created by the Digital Preservation and Digital Repository Infrastructure teams at The National Archives will be added to this folder to make them available to digitisation partners and to serve as examples of the use of the CSV Schema Language.

An initial example CSV can be found in the [`example-data`](http://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-schema/tree/master/example-schemas/example-data) folder, which relates to the xml files to be found in its subfolder TEST_1 and further subfolders.  This is designed to be validated against the schema [`digitised_surrogate_tech_acq_metadata_v1_TESTBATCH000.csvs`](https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-schema/blob/master/example-schemas/digitised_surrogate_tech_acq_metadata_v1_TESTBATCH000.csvs).  In a genuine digitisation project, the files described by the metadata CSV would be JPEG2000s, but these would tend to be quite large, so to make downloading more practical for demonstration purposes, we have supplied only the XML which would normally be embedded within the JPEG2000 file.
